# ObjectToObjectMapper

Here's the source code for my posts serie about building object-to-object mapper. Samples given here introduce different 
implementations I built. Solution contains one project with all code. It's .NET Core 3.0 console application. 
When run, it measures how much time one or another approach takes over one million runs. There's also comparison with AutoMapper.
